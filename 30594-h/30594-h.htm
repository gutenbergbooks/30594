<h3>ORIGINAL ROYAL LETTERS TO THE GRAND MASTERS
OF MALTA.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(<i>Continued from</i> p. 99.)</p>

  <p>In my first communication I did myself the pleasure to send you a
  correct list of all the royal letters which had been sent by different
  English monarchs to the Grand Masters of Malta, with their dates, the
  languages in which they were written, and stating to whom they were
  addressed. I now purpose to forward with your permission from time to
  time, literal translations of these letters, which Mr. Strickland of this
  garrison has kindly promised to give me. The subjoined are the first in
  order, and have been carefully compared, by Dr. Vella and myself, with
  the originals now in the Record Office.</p>

  <p>The venerable and religious men, Sir Thomas Docreus, Prior of St.
  John's in this kingdom, and Sir W. Weston of your convent, Turcoplerius,
  have lately delivered to us the epistle of your Reverence, and when we
  had read it, they laid before us the commission which they had in charge,
  with so much prudence and address, and recommended to us the condition,
  well being, and honour of their Order with so much zeal and affection,
  that they have much increased the good will, which of ourselves we feel
  towards the Order, and have made us more eager in advancing all its
  affairs, so that we very much hope to declare by our actions the
  affection which we feel towards this Order.</p>

  <p>And that we might give some proof of this our disposition, we have
  written at great length to His Imperial Majesty, in <i>favour of
  maintaining the occupation</i> of Malta, and we have given orders to our
  envoys there to help forward this affair as much as they are able. The
  other matters, indeed, <!-- Page 558 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  our kingdom; but since we honour the foresaid Sir W. Weston with a
  peculiar affection, we have judged him worthy that we should render him
  more agreeable and more acceptable to your Reverence, by this our renewed
  recommendation; and we trust that you will have it the more easily in
  your power to satisfy this our desire, because, on account of the trust
  which you yourself placed in him, you appointed him special envoy to
  ourselves in behalf of the affairs of his Order, and showed that you
  honoured him with equal good will. We therefore most earnestly entreat
  your Reverence not to be backward in receiving him on his return with all
  possible offices of love, and to serve him especially in those matters
  which regard his office of Turcoplerius, and his Mastership. Moreover, if
  any honours in the gift and disposal of your Reverence fall due to you,
  with firm confidence we beg of you to vouchsafe to appoint and promote
  the foresaid Sir William Weston to the same, which favour will be so
  pleasing and acceptable to us, that when occasion offers we will
  endeavour to return it not only to your Reverence, but also to your whole
  Order. And may every happiness attend you.</p>

  <p>That the subject of the above letters may be better understood, it may
  be necessary to state that L'Isle Adam was driven out of Rhodes by the
  Sultan Solyman, after a most desperate and sanguinary struggle, which
  continued almost without intermission from the 26th of June to the 18th
  of December, 1523. From this date to the month of October, 1530, nearly
  seven years, the Order of St. John of Jerusalem had no fixed residence,
  and the Grand Master was a wanderer in Italy, either in Rome, Viterbo,
  Naples, or Syracuse, while begging of the Christian Powers to assist him
  in recovering Rhodes, or Charles V. to give him Malta as a residence for
  his convent. It was during this period that the above letters, and some
  others which I purpose sending hereafter, were written.</p>

<h3>PENNY SIGHTS AND EXHIBITIONS IN THE REIGN
OF JAMES I.</h3>

  <p>The following curious list may amuse some of your readers. I met with
  it among the host of panegyrical verses prefixed to Master Tom Coryate's
  <i>Crudities</i>, published in 1611. Even in those days it will be
  admitted that the English were rather fond of such things, and glorious
  Will himself bears testimony to the fact. (See <i>Tempest</i>, Act II.
  Sc. 2.) The hexameter verses are anonymous; perhaps one of your well-read
  antiquaries may be able to assign to them the author, and be disposed to
  annotate them. I would particularly ask when was Drake's ship broken up,
  and is there any date on the chair<a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> made from the wood, which is now to
  be seen at the Bodleian Library, Oxford?</p>

      <p>The tombe of Beauchampe, and sword of Sir Guy a Warwicke,</p>
      <p>The great long Dutchman, and roaring Marget a Barwicke,</p>
      <p>The mummied Princes, and Cæsar's wine yet i' Dover,</p>
      <p>Saint James his ginney-hens, the Cassawarway<a name="footnotetag2" href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> moreover,</p>

      <p>Downe-shearing Willowes with teeth as sharpe as a hand-saw,</p>
      <p>The lance of John a Gaunt, and Brandon's still i' the Tower,</p>
      <p>The fall of Ninive, with Norwich built in an hower.</p>
      <p>King Henries slip-shoes, the sword of valiant Edward,</p>

    </div>

  <p>In explanation of the last line, Tom went no less than 900 miles on
  one pair of soles, and on his return he hung up these remarkable shoes
  for a memorial in Odcombe Church, Somersetshire, where they remained till
  1702.</p>

<h3>THE IMPOSSIBILITIES OF OUR FOREFATHERS.</h3>

  <p>In turning over the pages of old authors, it is amusing to note how
  the <i>mountains</i> of our primitive ancestors have become
  <i>mole-hills</i> in the hands of the present generation! A few instances
  would, I think, be very instructive; and, to set the example, I give you
  the following from my own note-book.</p>

  <p><i>The Overland Journey to India.</i>&mdash;From the days of Sir John
  Mandeville, until a comparatively recent period, how portentous of
  danger, difficulty, and daring has been the "Waye to Ynde wyth the
  Maruelyes thereof!"</p>

  <p>In <i>Lingua, or the Combat of the Tongue</i>, by Brewer, London,
  1657, originally published in 1607, Heursis complains that Phantases had
  interrupted his cogitations upon three things which had troubled his
  brain for many a day:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Phant.</i> Some great matters questionless; what were they?</p>

  <p><i>Heur.</i> The quadrature of the circle, the philosopher's stone,
  and the <i>next way to the Indies</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Phant.</i> Thou dost well to meditate on these things all at once,
  for they'll be found out altogether, <i>ad græcas calendas</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Dr. Robertson's <i>Disquisition on the Knowledge the Ancients had of
  India</i>, shows that communications overland existed from a remote
  period; and we know that the East India Company had always a route open
  for their dispatches on emergent occasions; but let the reader consult
  the <i>Reminiscences</i> of Dr. Dibdin, and he will find an example of
  its utter uselessness when resorted to in 1776 to apprize the Home
  Government of hostile movements on the part of an enemy. To show,
  however, in a more striking light, the difference between the "overland
  route" a century back, and that of 1853, I turn up the <i>Journal of
  Bartholomew Plaisted</i>: London, 1757. This gentleman, who was a servant
  of the East India Company, tells us that he embarked at Calcutta in 1749
  for England; and, after encountering many difficulties, reached Dover
  <i>viâ</i> Bussorah, Aleppo, and Marseilles in twelve months! Bearing
  this in mind, let the reader refer to the London daily papers of this
  eighth day of November, 1853, and he will find that intelligence reached
  the city on that afternoon of the arrival at Trieste of the
  <i>Calcutta</i> steamer, furnishing us with telegraph advices
  from&mdash;</p>

<table class="nobctr" summary="Times by steamer." title="Times by steamer.">
<tr><td class="spacsingle">Bengal, Oct. 3. </td><td class="spacsingle">36 days!</td></tr>
<tr><td class="spacsingle">Bombay, Oct. 14. </td><td class="spacsingle">25 days!!</td></tr>
<tr><td class="spacsingle">Hong Kong, Sept. 27. </td><td class="spacsingle">46 days!!!</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Rapid as this is, and strikingly as it exemplifies the gigantic
  appliances of our day, the cry of Heursis in the play is still for the
  <i>next</i>, or a nearer <i>way to India</i>; and, besides the <i>Ocean
  Mail</i>, the magnificent sailing vessels, and the steamers of
  <i>fabulous</i> dimensions said to be building for the Cape route to
  perform the passage from London to Calcutta in thirty days, we are
  promised the <i>electric telegraph</i> to furnish us with news from the
  above-named ports in a less number of <i>hours</i> than <i>days</i> now
  occupied!</p>

<p><!-- Page 560 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page560"></a>{560}</span></p>

  <p>We have thus seen that the impetus once given, it is impossible to
  limit or foresee where this tendency to knit us to the farthermost parts
  of the world will end!</p>

  <p>"Steam to India" was nevertheless almost stifled at its birth, and its
  early progress sadly fettered and retarded by those whose duty it was to
  have fostered and encouraged it&mdash;I mean the East India Company. From
  this censure of a body I would exclude some of their servants in India,
  and particularly a name that may be new to your readers in connexion with
  this subject, that of the late Mr. Charles P. Greenlaw of Calcutta, to
  whom I would ascribe all honour and glory as the great <i>precursor</i>
  of the movement, subsequently so triumphantly achieved by the Peninsular
  and Oriental Company. This gentleman, at the head of the East India
  Company's Marine Establishment in Bengal, brought all the enthusiasm of
  his character to bear upon the question of steam <i>viâ</i> the Red Sea;
  and raised such an agitation in the several Presidencies, that the
  <i>slow coach</i> in Leadenhall Street was compelled to move on, and Mr.
  Greenlaw lived to see his labours successful. Poor Greenlaw was as deaf
  as a post, and usually carried on his arm a flexible pipe, with an ivory
  tip and mouth-piece, through which he received the communications of his
  friends. How often have I seen him, after an eloquent appeal on behalf of
  his scheme, hand this to the party he would win over to his views: and if
  the responses sent through it were favourable, he was delighted; but, if
  the contrary, his irascibility knew no bounds; and snatching his pipe
  from the mouth of the senseless man who could not see the value of "steam
  for India," he would impatiently coil it round his arm, and, with a
  recommendation to the less sanguine to give the subject the attention due
  to its importance, would whisk himself off to urge his point in some
  other quarter! I have already said that Mr. Greenlaw lived to see the
  overland communication firmly established; and his fellow citizens, to
  mark their high estimation of his character, and the unwearied
  application of his energies in the good cause, have embellished their
  fine "Metcalfe Hall" with a marble bust of this best of advocates for the
  interests of India.</p>

  <p>"<i>Hierosolyma est perdita.</i>"&mdash;Whilst studying in Germany, I
  remember seeing one day some Jews in a great passion because a few little
  boys had been shouting "Hep! hep!" On information I heard, that whenever
  the German knights headed a Jew-hunt in the Middle Ages, they always
  raised the cry "Hep! hep!" This is remembered even to the present

  custom for the most part to make wastepaper of the advertisements and
  prospectuses that are usually stitched up, in considerable numbers, with
  the popular reviews and magazines. Now, as these adventitious sheets
  often contain scraps and fragments of contemporaneous intelligence,
  literary and bibliographical, with occasional artistic illustrations,
  would it not be well to preserve them, and to bind them up in a separate
  form at the end of the year; connecting them with the particular review
  or magazine to which they belonged, but describing also the contents of
  the volume by a distinct lettering-piece?</p>

  <p>If the work of destruction of such frail, but frequently interesting
  records, should go on at the present rate, posterity will be in danger of
  losing many valuable data respecting the state of British literature at
  different periods, as depicted by a humbler class of documents, employed
  by it for the diffusion of its copious productions.</p>

<h3>ENGLISH REFUGEES AT YPENSTEIN.</h3>

  <p>When I was at Alkmaar about thirty years ago, I strolled to the
  neighbouring village of Heilo, on the road to Limmen, where I saw,
  surrounded by a moat, the foundations of the castle of Ypenstein. A view
  of this once noble pile is to be found in the well-known work of
  Rademaker, <i>Kabinet van Nederlandsche en Kleefsche Oudheden</i>. This
  place, as tradition tells, once witnessed the perpetration of a violent
  deed. When the son of the unfortunate Charles I. was an exile in our
  country, this house Ypenstein was occupied by a family of English
  emigrants, high in rank, who lived here for a while in quiet. How far
  these exiles were even here secure from the spies of Cromwell appeared on
  a certain dark night, after a suspicious vessel had been seen from the
  village of Egmond, when an armed band of the Protector's Puritans, led by
  a guide, marched over the heath to the house Ypenstein, seized all the
  inhabitants, and carried them off, by the way they had come, to the
  coast, put them on board, and transported them most probably to England.
  In such secresy and silence was this violation of territory and the
  rights of hospitality perpetrated, that no one in the neighbourhood
  perceived anything of the occurrence, except a miller who saw the troop
  crossing the pathless heath in the direction of the coast, but could not
  conceive what had brought so many persons together in such a place at
  midnight.</p>

  <p>I would gladly learn whether anything is known of this transaction;
  and if so, where I may find farther particulars of this English family,
  their probable political importance, &amp;c. To investigate the truth of
  this tradition, that we may acquit or convict the far-famed Cromwell of
  so foul a crime, cannot certainly be untimely now that two celebrated
  learned men have undertaken to vindicate his memory.&mdash;From the
  <i>Navorscher</i>.</p>

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Petrarch's Laura.</i>&mdash;Mr. Mathews, in his <i>Diary of an
  Invalid in Italy, &amp;c.</i>, p. 380., in speaking of the outrages and
  indignities which, during the Revolution, were committed throughout
  France on the remains of the dead, and were amongst the most revolting of
  its horrors, mentions, on the authority of a fellow-passenger, an
  eye-witness, that the body of Petrarch's Laura had been seen exposed to
  the most brutal indignities in the streets of Avignon. He told Mr.
  Mathews that <!-- Page 563 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page563"></a>{563}</span>it had been embalmed, and was found in a
  mummy state, of a dark brown colour. I have not met with any mention of
  these these circumstances elsewhere. Laura is stated to have died of the
  plague (which seems to render it unlikely that her body was embalmed):
  and according to Petrarch's famous note on his MS. of Virgil, she was
  buried the same day, after vespers, in the church of the Cordeliers. The
  date was April 1, 1348. That church was long celebrated for her tomb,
  which contained also the body of Hugues de Sade, her husband. The edifice
  is stated to be ruined, its very site being converted into a
  fruit-garden; but the tomb is said to be still entire under the ground:
  and more than twenty years after the French Revolution, a small cypress
  was pointed out as marking the spot where Laura was interred.</p>

  <p>Is the circumstance of the desecration of her tomb mentioned by any
  other writer? If it really took place, are we to conclude that the
  tree&mdash;if it still exists&mdash;marks only the place where she had
  been interred: for, that the body was rescued and recommitted to the
  tomb, can hardly be supposed?</p>

  <p><i>Henry, Earl of Wotton</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 173. 281.).&mdash;The
  editors of the <i>Navorscher</i> express their thanks to <span
  class="sc">Broctuna</span> for his reply to their Query, but hope he will
  kindly increase their debt of gratitude by elucidating three points which
  seem to them obscure:</p>

  <p>1. Which Lord Stanhope died childless? Not Henry, Lord Stanhope, for
  he (see p. 281.) left a son and two daughters; nor yet Philip, for his
  widow had borne him daughters. Or have we wrongly understood the letters
  <i>s.&nbsp;p.</i> to signify <i>sine prole</i>?</p>

  <p>2. Was it the Earl of Chesterfield, half-brother of Charles Henry van
  den Kerckhove, or Charles <!-- Page 564 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page564"></a>{564}</span>Stanhope his nephew, who took the name of
  Wotton?</p>

  <p>3. Knight's <i>National Cyclopædia of Useful Knowledge</i> (vol. xi.
  p. 374.) names James Stanhope, Earl Stanhope, the eldest son of the Hon.
  Alexander Stanhope, second son of Philip Stanhope, first Earl of
  Chesterfield. Had the latter then, besides the above-named (see p. 281.)
  Henry, Lord Stanhope, also other sons?</p>

  <p><i>Kicker-eating.</i>&mdash;Can any of your West Yorkshire readers
  supply me with information relative to a practice which is said formerly
  to have prevailed at Cleckheaton, of eating "kicker," or horseflesh? It
  is a fact that natives of that locality who come to reside at Leeds are
  still subjected to the opprobrium of being <i>kicker-eaters</i>.</p>

  <p class="author">H. W.</p>

  <p><i>Chadderton of Nuthurst, co. Lancashire.</i>&mdash;When did the
  family of Chadderton become extinct? Had Edmund Chadderton, son and heir

  marriages, and deaths? In short, any particulars relating to them down to
  the period of the extinction of this family would be most acceptable.</p>

  Lanesborough, in Ireland, die? And when Sir Charles Cotterell, the

  <p><i>The Mother of William the Conqueror.</i>&mdash;Can you or any of
  your correspondents say which is right? In Debrett's <i>Peerage</i> for
  1790 the genealogy of the Marchioness Grey gives her descent from "Rollo
  or Fulbert, who was chamberlain to Robert, Duke of Normandy; and of his
  gift had the castle and manor of Croy in Picardy, whence his posterity
  assumed their surname, afterwards written de Grey. Which Rollo had a
  daughter Arlotta, mother of William the Conqueror." Now history says that
  the mother of the Conqueror was Arlette or Arlotte, the daughter of a
  tanner at Falaise. We know how scrupulous the Norman nobility were in
  their genealogical records; and likewise that in the lapse of time
  mistakes are perpetuated and become history. Can history in this instance
  be wrong? and if so, how did the mistake arise? I shall feel obliged to
  any one who can furnish farther information on the subject.</p>

  <p>"<i>The Whole Duty of Man.</i>"&mdash;Of what nature is the testimony

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Quæsitor.</span></p>

  following note: "Oct. 13, 1698. Mr. Thomas Caulton, Vicar of Worksop, in
  Nottinghamshire, in the presence of William Thornton, Esq., and his lady,
  Mrs. Heathcote, Mrs. Ashe, Mrs. Caulton, and John Hewit, Rector of
  Harthill, declared the words following: 'Nov. 5, 1689. At Shire-Oaks,
  Mrs. Eyre took me up into her chamber after dinner, and told me that her
  daughter Moyser, of Beverley, was dead. Among other things concerning the
  private affairs of the family, she told me who was the author of <i>The
  Whole Duty of Man</i>, at the same time pulling out of a private drawer a
  MS. tied together, and stitched in 8vo., which she declared was the
  original copy written by Lady Packington her mother, who disowned ever
  having written the other books imputed to be by the same author,
  excepting <i>The Decay of Christian Piety</i>. She added, too, that it
  had been perused in MS. by Dr. Covel, Master of Trinity College,
  Cambridge, Dr. Stamford, Prebendary of York, and Mr. Banks, Rector of the
  Great Church at Hull.' Mr. Caulton declared this upon his death-bed, two
  days before his decease. W.&nbsp;T. and J.&nbsp;H." This is quoted from the Rev.
  W.&nbsp;B. Hawkins's Introduction to Pickering's edition of 1842; and a
  similar account, with unimportant variations, is given in "N. &amp; Q.,"

  <p><i>"It rained cats and dogs and little
  pitchforks."</i>&mdash;<i>Helter-skelter.</i>&mdash;What can be the
  origin of this saying? I can imagine that rain may descend with such
  sharpness and violence as to cause as much destruction as a shower of
  "pitchforks" would; but if any of your readers can tell me why heavy rain
  should be likened to "cats and dogs," I shall be truly obliged. Many
  years ago I saw a most cleverly drawn woodcut, of a party of travellers
  encountering this imaginary shower; some of the animals were descending
  helter-skelter from the clouds; others wreaking their vengeance on the
  amazed wayfarers, while the "pitchforks" were running into the bodies of
  the terrified party, while they were in vain attempting to run out of the
  way of those which were threatening to fall upon their heads, and thus
  striking them to the ground. So strange an idea must have had some

<div class="note">
  <p>[As to the etymology of <i>helter-skelter</i>, Sir John Stoddart

  principal meaning to be in the first part, it may probably come from the
  Islandic <i>hilldr</i> pugna; if in the latter part, it may be from the
  German <i>schalten</i>, to thrust forward, which in the dialect of the
  north of England means 'to scatter and throw abroad as molehills are when
  levelled;' or from <i>skeyl</i>, which in the same dialect is 'to push on
  one side, to overturn.'"]</p>

<h3>MACKEY'S "THEORY OF THE EARTH".</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 468.)</p>

  <p>About the year 1827, when the prosecutions for blasphemy were leading
  hundreds and thousands to see what could be said against Christianity,
  with a very powerful bias to make the most of all that they could find,
  some friends of mine, of more ingenuity than erudition, strongly
  recommended to my attention the works of a shoemaker at Norwich, named
  Mackey, who they said was more learned than any one else, and had
  completely shown up <i>the thing</i>. It is worth a note that I perfectly
  remember the cause of their excitement to have been the imprisonment of
  the Rev. Robert Taylor, for publishing various arguments against
  revelation. I examined several works of Mackey's, and I have yet one or
  two bound up among my wonders of nature and art. As in time to come, when
  neither love nor money will procure a copy of these books, some tradition
  may set inquirers looking after them, perhaps it may be worth while to
  preserve a couple of extracts for the benefit of those who have the sense
  to hunt the index of "N. &amp; Q." before they give up anything.</p>

  <p>"The story of <span class="sc">Abraham</span>, notwithstanding all the
  endeavours of theologians to give it the appearance of the history of
  human beings, has preserved its mythological features with an outline and
  colouring, easily to be recognised by every son of <i>Urania</i> [Ur of
  the Chaldees is subsequently made to contain the root of <i>Uranus</i>].
  We have just seen that the Egyptians have their harvest about the time
  which the sun <i>passes over</i> the equator, and if we go back to the
  time of <i>Abraham</i> we shall find that the equator [perhaps he means
  equinox] was in <i>Taurus</i>; the Egyptians must, then, have had their
  harvest while the sun was in the Bull; the Bull was, therefore, in their
  figurative way of speaking, the father of harvest, not only because he
  ploughed the ground, but because the sun was there when they got in their
  harvest: thus the Bull was doubly distinguished as their benefactor; he
  was now, more than ever, become the <i>Bull of life</i>, i.&nbsp;e. he was not
  only called <i>Abir</i>, the Bull, but <i>Abir-am</i> or Ab'-r-am, the
  <i>Bull of life</i>,&mdash;the father of harvest. And as their harvest
  was originally under the direction of Iseth, or Isis, whatever belonged
  to harvest was <i>Isiac</i>; but the Bull, <i>Abiram</i>, was now become
  the <i>father of Isiac</i>! and to give this the appearance of a human
  descent, they added to Abir, the masculine affix <i>ah</i>; then it
  became <span class="sc">Ab'-rh-am</span> who was the father of Isiac. And
  we actually find <i>this equivoque</i> in the hebrew history of
  <i>Abram</i> whom the Lord afterwards called <i>Abraham</i>, who was the
  <i>father of Isaac</i>, whose seed was to be countless as the sand on the
  sea-shore for multitude; even this is truly applied to <i>Isiac</i> the
  offspring of Ab'-rh-am; for countless indeed are the offspring of the
  <i>scythe and sickle</i>! but if we allow <i>Isiac</i> to be a <i>real
  son of Ab-rah-am</i> we must enquire after his <i>mother</i>. During the
  time that the equator [perhaps he means the sun] is passing through the
  constellation of the Bull in the spring, the Bull would <i>rise in the
  east</i> every morning in the harvest time, in Egypt,&mdash;but in the
  <i>poetical language of the ancients</i>, it would be said that, when
  <span class="sc">Abir-am</span> <i>consorts</i> with <i>Aurora</i> he
  will produce <i>Isiac</i>. But <i>Aurora</i> is well known to be the
  <i>golden splendour of the east</i>, and the brightness of the east is
  called <i>Zara</i>, and the morning star is <i>Serah</i>, in the eastern
  languages, and we find a similar change of sound in the name of Isaac's
  mother, whom the Lord would no longer call <i>Sarai</i> but Sarah.

  <p>In answer to the inquiry respecting this singular man, I beg to say
  that I remember him between the years 1826 and 1830, as a shoemaker in
  Norwich. He was in a low rank of trade, and in poor circumstances, which
  he endeavoured to improve by exhibiting at private houses an orrery of
  his own making. He was recognised as a "genius;" but, as may be seen by
  his writings, had little reverence for established forms of belief. At
  the period of which I speak, which was soon after the publication of his
  first work, I knew but little of his mind, and lost sight of him
  altogether till about 1840. Then circumstances connected with my own line
  of study led me to call on him in Doughty's Hospital, Norwich, an asylum
  for aged persons. I found him surrounded by astronomical apparatus,
  books, the tools of his former trade, and all kinds of strange litters.
  In the conversation that ensued, I learned much of the workings of his
  mind; though his high self-appreciation could not descend to unreserved
  converse with a woman. My object was, to ascertain by what steps he had
  arrived at his theory of the earth's motion, but I could gain nothing
  distinct. He mentioned the <i>Asiatic Researches</i> as containing vast
  information on his peculiar subject; quoted Latin, and I think Greek,
  authors; and seemed to place great dependence on Maurice and Bryant; but,
  above all, on Capt. Wilford's <i>Essays</i>. He showed me some elaborate
  calculations, at which he was then working and still fancied himself
  qualified, perhaps destined, to head a great revolution in the
  astronomical world. I cannot say how far his knowledge of geology went,
  as I am not well acquainted with that science. He had evidently read and
  studied deeply, but alone; his own intellect had never been brushed by
  the intellects and superior information of truly scientific men, and it
  appeared to me that a vast deal of dirt, real dirt, had accumulated in
  his mind. My visit disappointed and pained me, but he seemed gratified,
  and I therefore promised to call again, which I did, but he was not at
  home. I think this visit was soon after he had removed into the hospital,
  for I then purchased his last work, <i>The Age of Mental
  Emancipation</i>, published 1836, before he obtained that asylum. He died
  before 1849, but I do not know the exact year.</p>

  <p>In any next visit to Norwich, I will make inquiries on all points
  relating to Mackey, of the very few persons now left who took interest in
  him, and I think I can find the printer of his last pamphlet.</p>

  <p>I have not the work mentioned in "N. &amp; Q.;" but, besides his last
  work, I have <i>The Mythological Astronomy of the Ancients
  demonstrated</i>, which is partly in poetry.</p>

  <p>I have been obliged to write this Note in the first person, as I can
  give only my own impressions respecting Mackey; and I wish that ere this
  you may have received clearer information from more competent persons. If
  your Querist have the <i>least grain</i> of faith in the theory of
  Mackey, I hope he will not let the subject drop, for I have long been
  deeply interested in it.</p>

  <p>Mackey, of whom your correspondent inquires, was an entirely
  self-educated man, but a learned shoemaker, residing in Norwich. He
  devoted all his leisure time to astronomical, geological, and <!-- Page
  567 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page567"></a>{567}</span>philological pursuits; and had some share
  in the formation of a society in his native town, for the purpose of
  debating questions relative to these sciences. I have understood that he
  was for some time noticed by a small portion of the scientific world, but
  afterwards neglected, as, from his own account, he appears also to have
  been by his literary fellow townsmen; and at last to have died in a
  Norwich alms-house. This is but a meagre account of the man, but it is
  possible that I may be able to glean farther particulars on the subject;
  for a medical friend of mine, who some time ago lent me <i>Mythological
  Astronomy</i>, promised to let me see some papers in his possession
  relative to this learned shoemaker's career, and to a few of his
  unpublished speculations. When I have an opportunity of seeing these, I
  shall be glad to communicate to your correspondent through "N. &amp; Q."
  anything of interest. The title-page of <i>Mythological Astronomy</i>
  runs thus:</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The book contains a variety of subjects, but principally treats of the
  Hindoo, Greek, and Roman mythology; and endeavours to deduce all the
  fables and symbols of the ancients from the starry sphere. It also
  contains a singular hypothesis of the author's upon the celebrated island
  of Atlantis, mentioned by Plato and other Greek authors; and some very
  curious speculations concerning the doctrine of the change in the angle
  which the plane of the ecliptic makes with the plane of the equator.</p>

  <p>Urania's <i>Key to the Revelations</i> is bound up with the above
  work. I forgot to say that his <i>Ancient Mythology demonstrated</i> is
  written in verse, and afterwards more fully explained by notes. His
  poetical abilities, however, neither suit the subject, nor are of a very
  high order. His prose is better, but here and there shows the deficiency
  of education.</p>

<h3>SINCERE, SIMPLE, SINGULAR.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 195. 328. 399.)</p>

  <p>When a hive of bees is taken, the practice is to lay the combs upon a
  sieve over some vessel, in only that the honey may drain out of the
  combs. Whilst the combs are in the hive, they hang perpendicularly, and
  each cell is horizontal; and in this position the honey in the cells
  which are in the course of being filled does not run out; but when the
  combs are laid on the sieve horizontally, the cells on the lower side of
  the combs hang perpendicularly, and then the honey begins to run out of
  those that are not sealed up. The honey that so runs out is perfectly
  pure, and free from wax. The cells, however, that are sealed up with wax
  still retain their honey; and the ordinary process to extract it is to
  place the sieve with the combs upon it so near a fire as gradually to
  melt the wax, so as to let the honey escape. During this process, some
  portion of wax unavoidably gets mixed with the honey. Here then we have
  two kinds of honey: one in a perfectly pure state, and wholly <i>sine
  cerâ</i>; the other in some degree impure, and mixed <i>cum cerâ</i>. Can
  anything be more reasonable than to suppose that the former was called
  <i>sincerum mel</i>, just as we call it virgin honey? And this accords
  with Ainsworth's derivation, "ex sine et cerâ: ut mel purum dicitur quod
  cerâ non est permixtum." If it be said that there is nothing to show that
  the old Romans adopted the process I have described, I reply it is
  immaterial what process they followed in order to extract what would not
  flow out of itself; as whatever did flow out of itself would be <i>mel
  sine cerâ</i>.</p>

  <p>If such were the origin of the term, it is easy to see how
  appropriately, in a secondary sense, it would denote whatever was pure,
  sweet, unadulterated, and ingenuous.</p>

  <p>Now if we apply this sense to the line:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Sincerum est nisi vas quodcunque infundis acescit,"&mdash;</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>it will mean, "unless the vessel be sweet and pure, it will turn
  whatever you pour into it sour."</p>

  <p>This is the interpretation that has always hitherto been put upon the
  line; which is thus translated by Tommaso Gargallo, vol. iii. p. 19.
  edit. 1820:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Se non è puro il vase, ecco già guasto</p>
      <p>Che che v' infondi."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And by Francis (vol. iv. p. 27., 6th edit.):&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"For tainted vessels sour what they contain."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The context shows that this is the correct translation, as <i>sincerum
  vas</i> is obviously in opposition to "auriculas <i>collectâ sorde</i>
  dolentes," in the preceding line.</p>

  <p>The line itself plainly refers to the well-known fact, that if wine or
  other liquor be poured into a foul vessel, it will be polluted by it. Nor
  can I avoid noticing the elegant opposition, according to this
  construction, between the sweetness in <i>sincerum</i>, and the acidity
  in <i>acescit</i>.</p>

  <p>I also think that <span class="sc">Mr. Inglesby's</span> version
  cannot be correct for the following reason. Cracks may exist in every
  part of a vessel alike; and as the part filled by the liquor is always
  many times greater than the remainder of the vessel, cracks would more
  frequently occur in the former; and, as where air can get in the liquor
  can get out, it <!-- Page 568 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page568"></a>{568}</span>is plain that in the majority of instances
  the liquor would run away instead of turning sour. Now the line plainly
  contains a <i>general</i> affirmative proposition that all liquor
  whatsoever will be turned sour, unless the vessel be <i>sincerum</i>; and
  therefore that version cannot be right which applies only to a few
  instances.</p>

  <p>"Sincerum cupimus vas incrustare" is well rendered by Gargallo (vol.
  ii. p. 37.):</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;Insudiciar bramiamo</p>
      <p>Anco il vase più puro;"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>and by Francis (vol. iii. p. 39.):</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And joy th' untainted vessel to begrime."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The passage is well explained in the note to Baxter's <i>Hor.</i> (p.
  310. edit. 1809):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Incrustari vas dicitur cum aliquo vitioso succo illinitur atque
  inquinatur."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And the passage in the 18th satire of Lucilius shows that this is an
  accurate explanation:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;Regionibus illis</p>
      <p>Incrustatu' calix rutâ caulive bibetur."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A practice, I rather think, prevails in some parts of England of
  rubbing the inside of a vessel with sweet herbs, in order to flavour
  cyder or other liquor.</p>

  <p>It appears from the same note:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Fracta vasa et gypsare et pelliculare Veteres consuevêre. Gypsantur
  et pelliculantur vasa plena ad aëra et sordes excludendas. Sincerum
  proprie mel sine cerâ, vel, quod magis huc pertinet, vas non ceratum: nam
  a ceraturâ odorem vel saporem trahit."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>If these passages show the practice of sealing vessels with wax, they
  also show that the wax was what affected the flavour of the liquor.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Jeffcock</span> plainly errs in saying that
  <i>simplex</i> "does not mean without a fold, but once folded." In Latin
  we have the series <i>simplex</i>, <i>duplex</i>, <i>triplex</i>,
  &amp;c., corresponding precisely to the English <i>single</i>,
  <i>double</i>, <i>treble</i>, &amp;c. And as <i>single</i> denotes a
  thing without a fold, so does <i>simplex</i>. <span class="sc">Mr.
  Jeffcock's</span> derivation would make <i>simplex</i> and <i>duplex</i>
  mean the same thing. Now <i>duplex</i> does not mean twice folded, but
  double.</p>

  <p>Nor can I think that <i>singulus</i> can be "semel and termination."
  Ainsworth derives it from the Hebrew <span lang="he" class="heb"
  title="SGLH" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E1;&#x5D2;&#x5DC;&#x5D4;</bdo></span>&#x200E;, which
  denotes whatever is peculiar or singular. It occurs to me to suggest
  whether it may not be derived from <i>sine angulis</i>. The term denotes
  unity&mdash;one person, one thing. Now the Roman mark for one is a
  straight line, and that is "that which lies evenly between its extreme
  points;" it is emphatically a line without bend, angle, or
  turning&mdash;"linea sine <span class="correction" title="Original reads `angulus', corrected by errata in Issue 218."
  >angulis</span>:" <i>angulus</i>, like its Greek original, denoting any
  bend, whether made by a straight or curved line.</p>

  <p>Though I cannot at this moment refer to any other Latin words
  compounded of <i>sine</i>, we have in Spanish <i>simpar</i>, without
  equal: <i>sinigual</i>, <i>sinjusticia</i>, <i>sinrazon</i>,
  <i>sinnumero</i>, <i>sinsabor</i>.</p>

  <p>The delight I take in endeavouring to attain the correct meaning of
  the classics will, I hope, form some apology for the length of this
  Note.</p>

<h3>HOMO UNIUS LIBRI.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 440.)</p>

  <p>I have not verified in the works of St. Thomas this saying ascribed to
  him, but I subjoin a passage from Bishop Taylor, where it is quoted:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A river cut into many rivulets divides also its strength, and grows
  contemptible and apt to be forded by a lamb and drunk up by a summer sun;
  so is the spirit of man busied in variety, and divided in itself; it
  abates its fervour, cools into indifferency, and becomes trifling by its
  dispersion and inadvertency. Aquinas was once asked, with what compendium
  a man might best become learned? He answered, <i>By reading of one
  book</i>; meaning that an understanding entertained with several objects
  is intent upon neither, and profits not." &mdash;<i>Life of Christ</i>,
  part ii. s. xii. 16.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>He also quotes Ecclus (xi. 10.), St. Gregory, St. Bernard, Seneca,
  Quintillian, and Juvenal to the same purpose.</p>

  <p>Southey quotes part of this passage from Bishop Taylor (in the
  <i>Doctor</i>) and adds:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Lord Holland's poet, the prolific Lope de Vega, tells us to the same
  purport. The <i>Homo Unius Libri</i> is indeed proverbially formidable to
  all conversational figurantes: like your sharpshooter, he knows his
  piece, and is sure of his shot."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The truth of this dictum of St. Thomas cannot be too much insisted on
  in this age of many books, which affords such incentives to literary
  dissipation and consequent shallowness.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"An intellectual man, as the world now conceives of him, is one who is
  full of 'views,' on all subjects of philosophy, on all matters of the
  day. It is almost thought a disgrace not to have a view at a moment's
  notice on any question from the Personal Advent to the Cholera or
  Mesmerism. This is owing in a great measure to the necessities of
  periodical literature, now so much in request. Every quarter of a year,
  every month every day, there must be a supply for the gratification of
  the public, of new and luminous theories on the subjects of religion,
  foreign politics, home politics, civil economy, finance, trade,
  agriculture, emigration, and the colonies. Slavery, the gold fields,
  German philosophy, the French empire, Wellington, Peel, Ireland, must all
  be practised on, day after day, by what are called original
  thinkers."&mdash;<i>Dr. Newman's Disc. on Univ. Educ.</i>, p. xxv.
  (preface).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This writer follows up the subject very ably, and his remarks on that
  spurious philosophism which shows itself in what, for want of a better
  word, he calls "viewiness," are worth the attention of all <i>homines
  unius libri</i>.</p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;As I think of it, I shall make a cognate Query. Some
  facetious opponent of the schoolmen fathered on St. Thomas Aquinas an
  imaginary work in sundry folio volumes entitled <i>De Omnibus Rebus</i>,
  adding an equally bulky and imaginary supplement&mdash;<i>Et Quibusdam
  Aliis</i>. This is as often used to feather a piece of unfledged wit, as
  the speculation concerning the number of angels that could dance on the
  point of a needle, and yet I have never been able to trace out the
  inventor of these visionary tomes.</p>

<h3>THE FORLORN HOPE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 411.)</p>

  <p>My attention was directed to the consideration of this expression some
  years ago when reading in John Dymmoks' <i>Treatise of Ireland</i>,
  written about the year 1600, and published among the <i>Tracts relating
  to Ireland, printed for the Irish Archæological Society</i>, vol. ii.,
  the following paragraph:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Before the vant-guard marched the <i>forelorn hope</i>, consisting of
  forty shott and twenty shorte weapons, with order that they should not
  discharge untill they presented theire pieces to the rebells' breasts in
  their trenches, and that sooddenly the short weapons should enter the
  trenches pell mell: vpon eyther syde of the vant-guarde (which was
  observed in the batle and reare-guarde) marched wings of shott enterlyned
  with pikes, to which were sent secondes with as much care and diligence
  as occasion required. The baggage, and a parte of the horse, marched
  before the battell; the rest of the horse troopes fell in before the
  <i>rearewarde</i> except thirty, which, in the head of the <i>rearelorne
  hope</i>, conducted by Sir Hen. Danvers, made the retreit of the whole
  army."&mdash;P.32.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The terms <i>rearelorne hope</i> and <i>forlorne hope</i> occur
  constantly in the same work, and bear the same signification as in the
  foregoing.</p>

  <p>Remarking upon this circumstance to my friend the late Dr. Graves, he
  wrote the following notice of the word in the <i>Dublin Quarterly Journal
  of Medical Science</i>, of which I was then the editor, in Feb. 1849:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Military and civil writers of the present day seem quite ignorant of
  the true meaning of the words <!-- Page 570 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page570"></a>{570}</span><i>forlorn hope</i>. The adjective has
  nothing to do with despair, nor the substantive with the 'charmer which
  lingers still behind;' there was no such poetical depth in the words as
  originally used. Every corps marching in any enemy's country had a small
  body of men at the head (<i>haupt</i> or <i>hope</i>) of the advanced
  guard; and which was termed the <i>forlorne hope</i> (<i>lorn</i> being
  here but a termination similar to <i>ward</i> in <i>forward</i>), while
  another small body at the head of the rere guard was called the
  <i>rear-lorn hope</i> (xx.). A reference to Johnson's <i>Dictionary</i>
  proves that civilians were misled as early as the time of Dryden by the
  mere sound of a technical military phrase; and, in process of time, even
  military men forgot the true meaning of the words. It grieves me to sap
  the foundations of an error to which we are indebted for Byron's
  beautiful line:</p>

<h3>TIECK'S "COM&OElig;DIA DIVINA."</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 126.)</p>

  <p>The title-page of this work is: <i>Com&oelig;dia Divina, mit drei
  Vorreden von Peter Hammer, Jean Paul, und dem Herausgeber</i>, 1808. The
  absence of publisher's name and place of publication leaves little doubt
  that the name W.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;H. Gotthardt, and the date "Basel, Mai 1, 1808," are
  both fictitious.</p>

  <p>But for finding the passage cited by M.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;E. at p. 38., I should have
  supposed that the Munich critic had referred to some other book with the
  same title. No one who has read this can suppose it was written by Tieck.
  The Catholic-romantic school, of which he was the most distinguished
  member, furnishes the chief objects of the author's ridicule. Novalis,
  Görres, and F. Schlegel are the most prominent; but at p. 128. is an
  absurd sonnet "an Tieck."</p>

  <p>The <i>Com&oelig;dia Divina</i> is a very clever and somewhat profane
  satire, such as Voltaire might have written had he been a German of the
  nineteenth century. It opens with Jupiter complaining to Mercury of ennui
  (<i>eine langweilige Existenz</i>), and that he is not what he was when
  young. Mercury advises a trip to Leipzig fair, where he may get good
  medical advice for his gout, and certainly will see something new. They
  go, and hear various dealers sing the catalogues of their goods. The
  lines quoted by M.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;E. are sung by a young man with a puppet-show and
  barrel-organ to the burden:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Orgelum Orgelei,</p>
      <p>Dudeldum Dudeldei."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>He exhibits things taken from the physics of Oken, the metaphysics of
  Schelling, and the æsthetics of Görres. The whole of the song is good;
  and I quote one stanza as showing a sound appreciation of the current
  metaphysicians:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Die Intelligenz construirt sich in der Zeit</p>
      <p>Als Object, und erkennt sich, und das ist gescheidt,</p>
      <p>Denn aus diesen und andern Constructuren</p>
      <p>Entstehen Lehrbücher und Professuren."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>They visit the garret of Herr Novalis Octavianus Hornwunder, a maker
  of books to order upon every subject: they learn the mysteries of the
  manufacture. The scene is clever, but much of the wit is unappreciable as
  directed against productions which have not survived. Jupiter, in
  compassion to Hornwunder, changes him to a goose, immediately after which
  a bookseller enters, and, mistaking the gods for authors, makes them an
  offer of six dollars and twelve groschen the octavo volume, besides
  something for the kitchen. Jupiter, enraged, changes him to a fox, which
  forthwith eats the goose "feathers and all."</p>

  <p>They then go to see the play of the Fall of Man (<i>Der
  Sündenfall</i>). The subject is treated after the manner of Hans Sachs,
  but with this difference, that the simple-minded old Nuremberger saw
  nothing incongruous in making Cain and Abel say their catechism, and Cain
  go away from the examination to fight with the low boys in the street;
  whereas the author of <i>Der Sündenfall</i> is advisedly irreverent.
  Another proof, if one were wanted, that he was not Tieck.</p>

  <p><i>Die Ungöttliche Comödie</i> is not by Batornicki, but translated by
  him from the Polish. In the preface he apologises for inelegant German,
  as that is not his native language; and I presume he is a Pole, as he
  says the author's name is known among us (<i>unter uns</i>). As he calls
  it a poem (<i>Dichtung</i>) the original is probably in verse. I think
  the Munich critic could have seen only some extracts from the
  <i>Com&oelig;dia Divina</i>; for, so far from Batornicki "plundering
  freely," I do not find any resemblance between the works except in the
  sole word <i>com&oelig;dia</i>. The <i>Com&oelig;dia Divina</i> is a
  mockery, not political, but literary, and as such anti-mystic and
  conservative. <i>Die Ungöttliche Comödie</i> is wild, mystical,
  supernatural, republican, and communistic. It contains passages of great
  power, eloquence, and pathos. German critics are often prosy and
  inefficient, but not given to wilful misrepresentation or carelessness in
  examining the books they review. The writer in the Munich journal must be
  held an exception.</p>

<h3>LIVERIES WORN BY GENTLEMEN.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vi., p. 146.; Vol. viii., p. 473.)</p>

  <p>The prevalence of the custom of the liveries of noble and other
  persons being worn by others than the retainers of the family, in the
  reigns of Henry VI. and Elizabeth, is exemplified by two documents
  preserved amongst the MSS. of the corporation of this borough. The first,
  which is also curious as a specimen of the language of the period, is an
  award under the seal of Margaret of Anjou; under whom, as they had
  previously done under Katherine, queen of Henry V., the corporation
  farmed the bailiwick of the town:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  Lady of Irland, Doughter of the Kyng of Sicile and Jer<span

  ... She doth therefore "ordeyn, deme, and awarde" that the said Lord
  Ferrers pay c. marks to William Neuby, that he "be goode lorde to the

  &amp;c.... "Yeven the xx day of May, the yere of the reign of my most
  douted Lord Kyng Henr' the Sext, xxvii."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The above extracts show one of the evils to which the practice led;
  another, mentioned in the deed, was that of deerstealing. William Newby
  was mayor of the town in 1425, 1433, and 1444-5.</p>

  <p>The second document is a curious letter from the mayor and some
  members of the corporation to George Earl of Huntington, lord-lieutenant
  of the county, and a frequent resident in the town, where a part of his
  mansion, called "Lord's Place," and in which James I. was entertained,
  still exists. The draft of this letter forms part of an interesting
  series of correspondence between the corporation and the earl, respecting
  the nomination of the parliamentary representatives of the town in
  1601.</p>

  <p>The earl recommended that Mr. (afterwards Sir) William Herrick and Mr.
  Bromley should be chosen, and in strong language warned them against
  electing Mr. George Belgrave of Belgrave (who had greatly offended him),
  as he hears "that Belgrave still contineweth his great practising in
  labouring to be chosen;" and he adds, "Goode Mr. Mayor, be carefull of
  this, as you and the rest will looke to make accompt of me."</p>

  <p>It appears that many members of the corporation were secretly
  favourable to Mr. Belgrave, and he was elected, as explained in the
  following letter:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Right Ho<sup>e</sup>, oure humble dewties rem<span

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Queries on Dr. Diamond's Calotype Process.</i>&mdash;Would you
  kindly ask <span class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span>, to whom I should imagine
  all of us are more or less indebted, the following questions respecting
  the very valuable paper on the calotype in the last <i>Photographic
  Journal</i>?</p>

  <p>1. As to the white spots which make their appearance in developing, on
  Turner's paper especially, and which he says are owing to minute pieces
  of metal in the paper, what is the best way of hiding them in the
  negative, so that they may as little as possible injure the positive? I
  have suffered sadly from this cause; and have tried to stop them with
  ammonio-nitrate, which turns after a time to red, and stops the light
  effectually; but I should prefer some black colouring the strength of
  which one could measure by seeing its immediate effect.</p>

  <p>2. And again, when one has black spots, what is the best means of
  lessening their intensity, if not of wholly removing them?</p>

  <p class="author"><span title="Phôtographos." class="grk">&Phi;&omega;&tau;&omicron;&gamma;&rho;&alpha;&phi;&omicron;&sigmaf;.</span></p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[Where light spots occur in a negative, <span class="sc">Dr.
  Diamond</span> recommends, as the most effectual mode of stopping them, a
  little gamboge neatly applied with a camel-hair pencil. Where a great
  intensity is desired, Indian ink may be applied in the same manner,
  taking care in both cases to smooth off the edges with a dry brush. The
  cyanide of potassium applied in the same way, but <i>with very great

  <p><i>Albumenized Paper.</i>&mdash;I have followed <span class="sc">Dr.
  Diamond's</span> directions for albumenizing paper (thin Canson negative)
  as accurately as I can, but I cannot prevent the albumen in drying, when
  pinned up, from forming into waves or streaks. This will be best
  understood from a specimen of a sheet which I inclose, and I shall be
  much obliged if you can tell me how this can be avoided. Some albumenized
  paper which I have purchased is quite free from this defect, but being at
  a distance from London, it is both convenient and economical to prepare
  my own paper.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[We would recommend our correspondent to remove his paper from the
  albumen still more slowly; and to take care not to draw it along, but so
  to lift it that the last corner is not moved until it is raised from the
  albumen. In pinning up be careful that the paper takes the inward curl,
  otherwise the appearances exhibited will be almost sure to take place. As
  the albumenizing liquid is of very trifling cost, we recommend the use of
  two dishes, as by that means a great economy of time is obtained.]</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"As for there being no sparrows at Lindham, it may be accounted for in
  the following legend:&mdash;A few years ago I was in that district when I
  heard some account of a person called 'Tom of Lindham;' who, by the way,
  was a curious personage, and performed some very extraordinary and
  out-of-the-way feats. At one time he was left at home to protect the corn
  from the <i>sparrows</i>; when, <i>to save trouble</i>, he got all of
  them into the barn, and put a <i>harrow</i> into the window to keep them
  in; and so <i>starved</i> (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> hungered) them to death."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Furthermore Mr. Whittaker kindly communicated of the above Yorkshire
  worthy:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"At the close of Tom's life he took it into his head to make a road
  across a part of Hatfield Chase to his own dwelling; when, according to
  the legend, he employed supernatural aid: with this clause in the
  contract, that he, Tom, should not inquire any particulars as to the
  character of his assistants or helpmates. One day, however, being more
  curious than prudent, he looked behind him; his workmen immediately
  disappeared, and Tom of Lindham was no more heard of. His road still
  remains in the state he left it."</p>

  <p><i>Vault at Richmond, Yorkshire</i> (Vol. viii., p.

  St. Martin, every tradition, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> as to its whereabouts, is, I
  believe, now wholly lost.</p>

  <p>Your Querist, however, who seems to feel an interest in that beautiful
  and romantic portion of the <i>north countrie</i>, will perhaps welcome
  the following mythe, which is connected, it is possible, with the
  identical <i>vault</i> which is depictured by Speed in his <i>Plan of
  Richmond</i>. It was taken down from the lips of a great-grand-dame by
  one of her descendants, <i>both of whom are still living</i>, for the
  gratification of your present correspondent, who, like Luther,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Would not for any quantity of gold part with the wonderful tales
  which he has retained from his earliest childhood, or met with in his
  progress through life."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But to my legend:</p>

  <p>Once upon a time a man, walking round Richmond Castle, was accosted by
  another, who took him into a <i>vennel</i>, or underground passage, below
  the castle; where he beheld a vast multitude of people lying as if they
  were sleeping. A <i>horn</i> and a <i>sword</i> were presented to him:
  the horn to blow, and the sword to draw; in order, as said his guide, to
  release them from their slumbers. And when he had drawn the sword half
  out, the sleepers began to move; which frightened him so much, that he
  put it back into the sheath: when instantly a voice exclaimed,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4hg3">"Potter! <i>Potter Thompson!</i></p>
      <p class="i4">If thou had either drawn</p>
      <p class="i4">The <i>sword</i>, or blown the <i>horn</i>,</p>
      <p>Thou had been the luckiest man that ever was born."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>So ends the Legend of the Richmond Sleepers and Potter Thompson;
  which, mayhap, is scarcely worth preserving, were it not that it has
  preserved and handed down the characteristic, or rather trade, cognomen
  and surname of its timorous at least, if not cowardly, hero.</p>

  <p>The portrait painted by Terburgh probably represents Andries de
  Graeff, who, in 1672, is called by Wagenaar, in his <i>Vaderlandsche

  then necessary to ascertain whether this late burgomaster died in 1674.
  The family de Graeff also resided at Delft, where several of its members
  became magistrates.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Elsevir.</span></p>

  <p>The portrait of the old gentleman is, in my opinion, doubtless that of
  Andries de Graeff, who was elected burgomaster of Amsterdam in 1660, and
  filled the office several times afterwards, although after the year 1670
  his name no more appears on the list of burgomasters, which can very well

  <p><i>The Words "Mob" and "Cash"</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 386.

  origin and first introduction of the word <i>mob</i> fully stated in
  Trench's <i>Lectures on the Study of Words</i> (p. 124. fourth ed.). In

  Rusticus</span> may refer to Dryden's preface to <i>Cleomenes</i> (1692),
  to the 230th number of <i>The Tatler</i>, written by Swift (an. 1710),
  and to the Dean's <i>Introduction to Polite Conversation</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Cash.</i>&mdash;What Lord Holland may have meant by a legitimate
  English word it is hard to say. Dr. Johnson derives it from the Fr.
  <i>caisse</i> (or <i>casse</i>), which Cotgrave interprets "a box, a
  <i>case</i>, <!-- Page 574 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page574"></a>{574}</span>or chest; also, a merchant's <i>cash</i>
  or counter." Todd confirms the correctness of Johnson's etymology by a
  usage in Winwood's <i>Memorials</i>; where the Countess of Shrewsbury is
  said to have 20,000<i>l.</i> in her <i>cash</i>. And Richardson farther
  confirms it by a quotation from Sir W. Temple; and one from Sherwood, who
  explains <i>cashier</i>, "Qui garde le <i>casse</i> de l'argent de
  merchand;" and a merchant's <i>cash</i>, "<i>casse</i> de merchand."</p>

  which will very probably recite his appointment; and this record is most

  list of churches where exterior stoups may be seen, the names of Leigh
  and Shrawley, Worcestershire. A recent visit to these places made me
  aware of the existence of the stoups. That at Leigh is in a shattered
  condition, and is on the south side of the western doorway: it is now
  covered in by a porch of later date. That at Shrawley is on the eastern
  side of the south door, and is hollowed out within the top of a short
  column. Shrawley Church possesses many points of interest for the
  antiquary: among which may be mentioned, a Norman window pierced through
  one of the buttresses of the chancel. Among the noticeable things at
  Leigh Church is a rude sculpture of the Saviour placed exteriorly over
  the north door of the nave, in a recess, with semicircular heading and
  Norman pillars. The rector is gradually restoring this fine church.</p>

  <p><i>Green Jugs used by the Templars</i> (Vol. viii., p. 171.)&mdash;In
  clearing out the ground for the foundation of Raymond Buildings in Gray's
  Inn, about thirty years since, two earthen green jugs were dug up, which
  are preserved by the benchers as a memento of "the olden times."</p>

  <p>They will hold very little more than half a pint of liquor, are tall
  and of good proportions, but so small at the top as almost to preclude
  their being used to drink out of, and having a lip it is surmised that
  they held the portion assigned to each student, who was also supplied
  with a drinking horn.</p>

  <p>I have seen a jug of the same description in the possession of a
  gentleman in Lincoln's Inn, which he informed me was brought to light in
  excavating for the new hall. It is therefore probable that all the inns
  of court were accustomed to provide jugs of the same description.</p>

  <p><i>Raffaelle's Sposalizio</i> (Vol. vii., p. 595.; Vol. viii., p.
  61.).&mdash;The reason why the ring is placed on <!-- Page 575 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page575"></a>{575}</span>the third finger of the
  right hand of the Blessed Virgin in Raffaelle's "Sposalizio" at Milan,
  and in Ghirlandais's frescoe of the same subject in the Santa Croce at
  Florence, is to be found in the fact that the right hand has always been
  considered the hand of power or dignity, and the left hand of inferiority
  or subjection. A married woman always wears her ring on the third finger
  of the left hand to signify her subjection to her husband. But it has
  been customary among artists to represent the Blessed Virgin with the
  ring on the right hand, to signify her superiority to St. Joseph from her
  surpassing dignity of Mother of God. Still she is not always represented
  so, for in Beato Angelico's painting of the marriage of Mary and Joseph
  she receives the ring on her left hand. See woodcut in Mrs. Jameson's
  <i>Legends of Madonna</i>, p. 170. In the Marriage of the Blessed Virgin
  by Vanloo, in the Louvre, she also receives the ring on the left hand.
  Giotto, Taddeo Gaddi, Perugino, &amp;c., have painted the "Sposalizio,"
  but I have not copies by me to refer to.</p>

  <p><i>Phantom Bells&mdash;"The Death Bell"</i> (Vol. vii.

  on the death-wind, and heralds his doom to the hearer. Mickle alludes to
  it in his fine ballad of "Cumnor Halle:"</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p class="hg3">"The <i>death-belle</i> thrice was heard to ring,</p>

  <p>When ships go down at sea during a terrible tempest, it is said the

  <p><i>The Mitred Abbot in Wroughton Church, Wilts</i> (Vol. viii., p.
  411.).&mdash;The figure was painted in fresco, not on a pillar, but on
  the spandril-space between two arches. The vestments, as far as I can
  make out, are an alb, a tunicle and a cope, and mitre. The hands do not
  appear to hold anything, and I see nothing to show it to represent a
  mitred abbot rather than a bishop. The colours of the cope and tunicle
  were red and green, the exterior of the cope and the tunicle being of one
  colour, the interior of the cope of the other. The figure was the only
  perfect one when I visited the church, and the rain was washing it out
  even as I sketched; but there had been one between every two arches, and
  there were traces of colour throughout the aisle, and the designs
  appeared to me unusually elegant. I believe my slight sketch to be all
  that now remains; and shall be glad to send a copy of it to your
  correspondent if he wishes for it, and will signify how I may convey it

  edited by a frequent contributor to your pages, the <span class="sc">Rev.
  W. Fraser</span>, B.C.L., and is favourably mentioned by you, I find the
  following sentence, declaring that Sir Anthony Fitzherbert <i>was</i>
  Chief Justice:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I must admit that it is said in the second part of Rolle's
  <i>Abridgment</i>, that the Archbishop of Canterbury was prohibited to
  hold such assemblies by Fitzherbert, Chief Justice, because he had not
  the King's licence. But he adds that the Archbishop would not obey it;
  and he quotes Speed for it."&mdash;P. 38. of original pamphlet, and p.
  36. of Mr. Fraser's reprint.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Fraser</span> merely refers to Sir Anthony
  Fitzherbert as being made judge of the Common Pleas in 1523, and does not
  enter into this question, which deserves investigation.</p>

  <p>As to the meaning of the expression, I think there can be no doubt.
  Ainsworth interpreted "Scrupulum injecisti mihi, spem meam remoratus
  es."</p>

  <p>In Dutch, "Een spaak in t'wiel steeken," is "To traverse, thwart, or
  cross a design." See Sewel's <i>Woordenboek</i>.</p>

  <p>The effect is similar to that of <i>spiking</i> cannon. And it is not
  improbable that <i>spoke</i>, known by the <!-- Page 577 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page577"></a>{577}</span>ignorant to form part
  of the wheel, has been by them corrupted from <i>spike</i>: and that the

  from turning on its axle.</p>

  <p><i>Ballina Castle</i> (Vol. viii., p. 411.).&mdash;O. L. R. G.
  inquires about Ballina Castle, Castlebar, and of the general history,
  descriptions, &amp;c. of the co. Mayo. In the catalogue of my manuscript
  collections, prefixed to my <i>Annals of Boyle, or Early History of
  Ireland</i> (upwards of 200 volumes), No. 37. purports to be "one volume
  8vo., containing full compilations of records and events connected with
  the county of Mayo, with reference to the authorities," and it has
  special notices of Castlebar, Cong, Burrishoole, Kilgarvey, Lough Conn,
  &amp;c., and notes of scenery and statistics. I offered in the year 1847
  to publish a history of the county if I was indemnified, but I did not
  succeed in my application. I have, of course, very full notices of the
  records, &amp;c. of Ballina, and the other leading localities of that
  interesting but too long neglected county, which I would gladly draw out
  and assign, as I would any other of my manuscript compilations, to any
  literary gentleman who would propose to prepare them for publication, or
  otherwise extract and report from them as may be sought.</p>

  <p><i>Mardle</i> (Vol. viii., p. 411.).&mdash;This is the correct
  spelling as fixed by Halliwell. I should propose to derive it from A.-S.
  <i>mathelian</i>, to speak, discourse, harangue; or A.-S. <i>methel</i>,
  discourse, speech, conversation. (Bosworth.) Forby gives this word only
  with the meaning "a large pond;" a sense confined to Suffolk. But his

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>As long as poetry of the highest order is appreciated in England,
  Gray's <i>Elegy written in a Country Churchyard</i> will never want
  readers to pore over its beauties, or artists ready to dedicate their
  talents to its illustration. Of the latter fact we have evidence in a new
  edition just issued by Mr. Cundall, which is illustrated on every page
  with engravings on wood from drawings by Birkett Foster, George Thomas,
  and a Lady. The artists have caught the spirit of the poet, and their
  fanciful creations have been transferred to the wood with the greatest
  delicacy by the engravers,&mdash;the result being a most tasteful little
  volume, which must take a foremost rank among the gift-books of the
  coming Christmas.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received.</span>&mdash;<i>Smiths's Dictionary
  of Greek and Roman Geography, by various Writers</i>, Part VIII., which
  extends from the conclusion of the admirable article on <i>Etruria</i> to
  <i>Germania</i>, and includes <i>Gallia Cisalpina</i> and
  <i>Transalpina</i>, which scarcely required the initials (G.&nbsp;L.) to point
  out the accomplished scholar by whom they are written.&mdash;Darlings
  <i>Cyclopædia Bibliographica</i>: Parts XIV. and XV. extend from <i>O.&nbsp;M.
  Mitchell</i> to <i>Platina or De Sacchi</i>. The value of this
  analytical, bibliographical, and biographical Library Manual will not be
  fully appreciable until the work is completed.&mdash;<i>The National
  Miscellany</i>, Vol. I. The first Volume of this magazine of General
  Literature is just issued in a handsome form, suitable to the
  typographical excellence for which this well-directed and well-conducted
  miscellany is remarkable.&mdash;<i>Remains of Pagan Saxondom, principally
  from Tumuli in England</i>, Part VIII.: containing Bronze Bucket, found
  at Cuddesden, Oxfordshire; and Fibula, found near Billesdon,
  Leicestershire. We would suggest to Mr. Akerman that the Bronze Bucket is
  scarcely an example of an object of archæological interest, which
  requires to be drawn of the size of the original, and coloured from it:
  and that the value of his useful work would be increased by his adhering
  to his original arrangement, by which the illustrative letter-press
  appeared in the same part with the engraving to which it referred.</p>
